# Smart-Window
A project based on Arduino
Smart means it can open and close windows automatically by judging temperature’s and humidity’s differences and outside indexes of PM2.5 and PM1(particles with diameter smaller than 2.5 millimeters and 1 millimeters which can cause catastrophic air pollution and strong threats to humans’ health).  

Difference of temperature to judge if the air condition is open or not (larger than 8 Celsius Degrees)
Difference of humidity to judge if it’s raining outside(larger than 30 per cent)
PM2.5 larger than 100-close the window
PM1 larger than 80-close the window

The most difficult problem I face is the communication between two arduinos. My mentor Zhiwei Yu helps me and offer me some codes to communicate easily.
